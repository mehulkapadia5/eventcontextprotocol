# ECP (Event Context Protocol) — Replit Animation Video Prompt

## Video Concept
A sleek, modern 60-second animated explainer that shows how ECP takes developers from zero to real-time analytics in minutes. The tone is confident, minimal, and developer-friendly — think dark-mode aesthetics with glowing accent colors and smooth transitions.

## Prompt for Replit Animations

```
Create a 60-second animated explainer video for "ECP — Event Context Protocol", a developer-first event analytics platform. Use a dark theme (deep navy/charcoal background) with glowing electric-blue and soft-white accent colors. Modern, clean motion graphics style. Monospace typography for code elements, clean sans-serif for headings.

SCENE 1 — The Problem (0s–8s)
Open on a developer's screen cluttered with multiple analytics dashboards — PostHog, Mixpanel, Google Analytics tabs all open. The dashboards glitch and blur. Text fades in: "Analytics shouldn't be this complicated." All the clutter dissolves into particles.

SCENE 2 — Introducing ECP (8s–15s)
The particles reassemble into the ECP logo — an activity/pulse icon next to "ECP" in a clean monospace font. The logo pulses once with a subtle glow. Below it, the tagline types out letter-by-letter: "The semantic layer above your product data." A subtle grid pattern appears in the background, suggesting structured data.

SCENE 3 — Install in Seconds (15s–22s)
A terminal window slides in from the left. The command types itself out:
  npm install @ecp/sdk
A green checkmark appears. Then three lines of code animate in:
  import { ECP } from '@ecp/sdk'
  ECP.init('your-api-key')
  ECP.track('button_clicked', { plan: 'pro' })
Text overlay: "Three lines. That's it." The code block glows and shrinks into a small chip.

SCENE 4 — Real-Time Dashboard (22s–32s)
The chip flies to the top-right corner. A beautiful dashboard materializes — a line chart drawing itself showing event volume over 7 days, bar charts of top events animating upward, a live event feed scrolling with entries like "signup_completed", "page_viewed", "purchase_made". Counters tick up in real-time: "12,847 events", "2,341 unique users". The dashboard subtly breathes with life. Text: "Real-time. Beautiful. Zero bloat."

SCENE 5 — AI-Powered Context (32s–42s)
The dashboard zooms into the chat interface. An AI chat bubble appears: "What's my conversion rate this week?" The AI responds with a query executing animation, then shows: "Your signup-to-purchase conversion rate is 4.2%, up 0.8% from last week." A brain/neural network icon pulses. Connected nodes appear showing: GitHub repo icon → code analysis → event discovery → business insights. Text: "AI that understands your product, your code, and your goals."

SCENE 6 — Connect Everything (42s–50s)
Three integration cards float in and arrange themselves: PostHog logo, Mixpanel logo, GitHub logo. Glowing data streams flow from each card into a central ECP node. The node processes and emits structured, organized data ribbons outward. Text: "Import from PostHog, Mixpanel, Google Analytics. Connect your codebase. One unified view."

SCENE 7 — The Close (50s–60s)
Everything zooms out to reveal the full ECP ecosystem — SDK, dashboard, AI chat, integrations — all connected by flowing data lines forming a constellation pattern. The constellation contracts into the ECP logo. Final text sequence:
  "ECP — Event Context Protocol"
  "From zero to analytics in under five minutes."
  "Start Tracking Free →"
The logo and CTA pulse gently. Fade to dark.

MUSIC & SOUND:
- Ambient electronic track, minimal and modern (think Tycho or Loscil vibes)
- Subtle UI sound effects: soft clicks for code typing, gentle whooshes for transitions, a satisfying chime when the dashboard loads
- Bass drop on the logo reveal in Scene 2

MOTION STYLE:
- Smooth easing (ease-in-out) on all transitions
- Subtle parallax depth on background elements
- Micro-animations: pulsing dots, flowing particles, breathing glows
- No harsh cuts — everything morphs, dissolves, or flows into the next element
- 60fps, crisp vector graphics throughout
