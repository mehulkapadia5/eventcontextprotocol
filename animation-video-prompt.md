# ECP (Event Context Protocol) — Replit Animation Video Prompt

## Video Concept
A sleek, modern 60-second animated explainer that shows how ECP gives product teams instant analytics by connecting their existing tools — no SDK, no code changes. The tone is confident, minimal, and developer-friendly — think dark-mode aesthetics with glowing accent colors and smooth transitions.

## Prompt for Replit Animations

```
Create a 60-second animated explainer video for "ECP — Event Context Protocol", a developer-first event analytics platform. Use a dark theme (deep navy/charcoal background) with glowing electric-blue and soft-white accent colors. Modern, clean motion graphics style. Monospace typography for code elements, clean sans-serif for headings.

SCENE 1 — The Problem (0s–8s)
Open on a developer's screen cluttered with multiple analytics dashboards — PostHog, Mixpanel, Google Analytics tabs all open. Data is scattered, disconnected, and overwhelming. Text fades in: "Your data is everywhere. Your insights are nowhere." All the clutter dissolves into particles.

SCENE 2 — Introducing ECP (8s–15s)
The particles reassemble into the ECP logo — an activity/pulse icon next to "ECP" in a clean monospace font. The logo pulses once with a subtle glow. Below it, the tagline types out letter-by-letter: "The semantic layer above your product data." A subtle grid pattern appears in the background, suggesting structured data.

SCENE 3 — Connect Your Analytics (15s–25s)
A clean onboarding card slides in. Four provider logos appear as cards: PostHog, Mixpanel, Google Analytics, Metabase. A cursor clicks on PostHog — the card expands smoothly, showing input fields for API Key and Project ID. The fields fill in with a typing animation, a "Connect" button glows and gets clicked. A green checkmark animates in: "Connected." Behind the card, a stream of event data particles begins flowing from the PostHog logo into a central glowing ECP node. Text overlay: "Connect your existing analytics in seconds. No code changes."

SCENE 4 — Connect Your Codebase (25s–33s)
The analytics card slides left. A new card appears showing the GitHub logo. A repository URL types itself in: "github.com/acme/webapp". A personal access token field fills with dots. Click "Connect." The ECP node pulses — a visual scan animation ripples through a file tree (package.json, src/, components/). AI sparkle effects appear as the system reads the codebase. Discovered events bubble up as floating tags: "signup_completed", "purchase_made", "page_viewed", "plan_upgraded". Text: "ECP reads your code and discovers what to track."

SCENE 5 — Teach the AI Your Business (33s–42s)
The screen transitions to a chat interface. An AI message appears: "What does your product do?" A user types: "We're a SaaS platform for team collaboration." The AI responds, and a circular progress ring fills from 0% to 85% labeled "Business Understanding." The AI asks follow-ups about audience and goals. The ring fills to 100% and transforms into a green checkmark with "Context Complete." Three labeled nodes glow into view: "Product → Audience → Goals." Text: "An AI that learns your product, audience, and goals."

SCENE 6 — The Dashboard Comes Alive (42s–52s)
All three context streams (analytics data, codebase context, business understanding) visually merge into the ECP dashboard. A line chart draws itself showing event volume over 7 days. Bar charts of top events animate upward. A live event feed scrolls with entries. Counters tick up: "12,847 events", "2,341 unique users". The AI chat panel slides in from the right — a user asks: "What's my conversion rate this week?" The AI responds: "4.2%, up 0.8% from last week." Text: "Real-time insights. AI-powered answers. Zero bloat."

SCENE 7 — The Close (52s–60s)
Everything zooms out to reveal the full ECP ecosystem — four connected nodes in a constellation: Analytics (PostHog/Mixpanel/GA), Codebase (GitHub), Business Context (AI chat), and Dashboard (charts + AI). Flowing data lines connect them all through the central ECP logo. The constellation contracts into the ECP logo. Final text sequence:
  "ECP — Event Context Protocol"
  "From zero to analytics in under five minutes."
  "Start Free →"
The logo and CTA pulse gently. Fade to dark.

MUSIC & SOUND:
- Ambient electronic track, minimal and modern (think Tycho or Loscil vibes)
- Subtle UI sound effects: soft clicks for typing, gentle whooshes for transitions, a satisfying chime when connections complete
- Bass drop on the logo reveal in Scene 2
- Soft confirmation tones on each green checkmark

MOTION STYLE:
- Smooth easing (ease-in-out) on all transitions
- Subtle parallax depth on background elements
- Micro-animations: pulsing dots, flowing particles, breathing glows
- No harsh cuts — everything morphs, dissolves, or flows into the next element
- 60fps, crisp vector graphics throughout
- Data stream particles should flow continuously once analytics is connected, building visual momentum through each scene
